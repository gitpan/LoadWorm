
LoadWorm - WebSite Stress and Validation Tool

The LoadWorm is a tool to load a website with programmed requests, and to
record the resultant performance, from a web client's perspective.  It can
also be used for various investigative purposes, such as validation of the
website, or discovering all the referrers to a page, etc. I have already
used it to discover faults that have lead to a major re-architecting here
at SaveSmart commercial site(s). It runs, unaltered, on Unix and Win32
(tested on Solaris 2.4, Linux, and WinNT 4.0).

This is an application, written in Perl, that uses LWP, LWP::Parallel,
sockets (lots of them!), and Tk, so there is plenty to get your hands onto
here. The pod will tell you how to operate it.

LATEST VERSION: (also the initial CPAN version) is 0.10
